# AI From Scratch

Building ML models from scratch using Python. (and simple libraries like numpy and math)

## Projects

- **LinearRegression.py**: linear regression model with multiple variables.
- **UnivariateLinearRegression.py**: linear regression model with a single variable.
- **KMeans.py**: clustering algorithm for partitioning data into K clusters.
- **CrossValidation.py**: evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of these projects, simply clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YassWorks/AI-From-Scratch.git
cd AI-From-Scratch
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
