# AI From Scratch

Building ML models from scratch using Python. (and simple libraries like numpy and math)

## Projects

- **LinearRegression.py**: linear regression model with multiple variables.
- **UnivariateLinearRegression.py**: linear regression model with a single variable.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of these projects, simply clone the repository and run the desired Python file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YassWorks/AI-from-scratch.git
cd AI-FromScratch
python LinearRegression.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
