# AI From Scratch

Building ML models from scratch using Python and basic libraries like numpy and math.

## Projects

This repository includes both supervised learning (regression and classification) and unsupervised learning projects:

- **LinearRegression.py**: linear regression model with multiple variables.
- **UnivariateLinearRegression.py**: linear regression model with a single variable.
- **LogisticRegression.py**: logistic regression model for binary classification.
- **KMeans.py**: clustering algorithm for partitioning data into K clusters.
- **CrossValidation.py**: evaluate the performance of machine learning models.
- **KNNRegression.py**: k-nearest neighbors regression model for predicting continuous values.
